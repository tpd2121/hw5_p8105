```{r birthday}
```

## Problem 2
```{r power}
a = rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = 5)

a_hat = mean(a)

#function will be one sample t-test formula

t_test = function(x) {
  
  t.test(a)
  
}

t_test(a)

output = vector("list", length = 5000)

for (i in 1:5000) {
  output[[i]] = t_test(a)
}

#need to figure out how to display the data, but the above code works.
