## Problem 1
Not graded

```{r birthday}
```

## Problem 2
```{r power}
a = rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = 5)

#function will be one sample t-test formula

ttest = function(x) {
  
  (mean(a) - 0) / (5 / sqrt(30))
  
}

ttest(a)

output = vector("list", length = 5000)

for (i in 1:5000) {
  output[[i]] = ttest(a)
}

#need to figure out how to display the data, but the above code works.
