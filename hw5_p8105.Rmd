## Problem 2
```{r power}
#test df
df1 = tibble(
  x = rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = 5))

#function: the dataset is part of the function because it's needed for repeated sampling
#the function is t.test directly
a_sample = function(a) {
  a_data = tibble(
    a = rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = 5))
  a_result = t.test(a_data)
}

#writing loop
#use tidy as part of the output immediately to create a tibble
output = vector("list", length = 5000)

for (i in 1:5000) {
  output[[i]] = tidy(a_sample())
}

#tidy dataframe result
df3 = bind_rows(output)

#repeat the above for mean = 1-6
#mean = 1
output2 = vector("list", length = 5000)

for (i in 1:5000) {
  output2[[i]] = tidy(a_sample(a(mean = 1)))
}

df4 = bind_rows(output2)

#mean = 2
output3 = vector("list", length = 5000)

for (i in 1:5000) {
  output3[[i]] = tidy(a_sample(a(mean = 2)))
}

df5 = bind_rows(output3)

#How to include # of iterations and input mean in the tibble?
